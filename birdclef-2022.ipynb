But many of the remaining birds across the islands are isolated in difficult-to-access, high-elevation habitats. With physical monitoring difficult, scientists have turned to sound recordings. Known as bioacoustic monitoring, this approach could provide a passive, low labor, and cost-effective strategy for studying endangered bird populations.\n\n## Goal:\n\nCurrent methods for processing large bioacoustic datasets involve manual annotation of each recording. This requires specialized training and prohibitively large amounts of time. Thankfully, recent advances in machine learning have made it possible to automatically identify bird songs for common species with ample training data. However, it remains challenging to develop such tools for rare and endangered species, such as those in Hawai'i.\n\nUse machine learning skills to identify bird species by sound. Specifically, develop a model that can process continuous audio data and then acoustically recognize the species. The ultimate goal is to be able to train reliable classifiers with limited training data.\n\n## Notes:\n\nFirst goal: EDA :)\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"## Import Statements\n\n# Data Manipulation\nimport numpy as np \nimport pandas as pd \n\n# Visualization\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\n\n# Modeling\n\nimport os\n# for dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n#     for filename in filenames:\n#         print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-28T01:38:11.517582Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-28T01:38:11.517842Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-28T01:38:11.523265Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-28T01:38:11.517814Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-02-28T01:38:11.522254Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":5,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Loading the Data","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"train = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/birdclef-2022/train_metadata.csv\")\ntest = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/birdclef-2022/test.csv\")\nsubmission = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/birdclef-2022/sample_submission.csv\")\ntaxonomy = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/birdclef-2022/eBird_Taxonomy_v2021.csv\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-28T01:51:06.367537Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-28T01:51:06.367812Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-28T01:51:06.572073Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-28T01:51:06.367784Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-02-28T01:51:06.571290Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":16,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Exploratory Data Analysis","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Modeling","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Submission","metadata":{}}]}
